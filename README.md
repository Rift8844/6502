# Rattle Stars
Rattle Stars is a mediocre 6502 CPU emulator, which uses an interpreter. After I finish this project, I might use it to make a full blown system emulator, such as an Apple II emulator.

## Building on Linux

To clone into this repository, run this command:
`git clone https://github.com/Rift8844/RattleStars`

To build this repository, run these commands:
`cd RattleStars`
`make`

By default, this will compile the binary with debugging flags on, and without compiler optimizations. You can change this in the makefile.
